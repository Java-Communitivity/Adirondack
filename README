This work is heavily based on work originally released by IgniteRealtime under
the name 'Whack API'. In fact this is a fork from 2009 May 23 of that software
for the following purposes:

* maintain a public Git-enabled project that is geared to work with other XMPP
  servers as well as OpenFire, most notably ejabberd

* provide a vendor-neutral repository for external component examples and
  sub-projects.

* Serve as a testing ground for experiments in XMPP component protocol
  extensions

Given the plans above and the nature of some of the modifications it seems
reasonable to use a different name.  We chose adirondack for the tie to NY and
for the common ack ending.

Modifications made by Communitivity.org up to this version:

* Removed org.jivesoftware.whack.container
* Removed libraries no longer needed due to above
* Created NetBeans project
* Moved the weather sam
* Converted build to Maven
* Temporarily reduced stringprep compliance by substituting use of java.text.IDN
  in place of jivesoftware stringprep jar classes, due to stringprep not being
  in a well-known Maven repo. May need to do a full compliance with uc4j.
  Should be fine for English based domain names.

Near-term planned modifications:

* OSGi compatibility
* Addition example components, each integrated into build as a separate Maven
  profile to maintain dependency separation
